.Sh NAME
.Nm kdump
.Nd display kernel trace data
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl acdjnlRT
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl m Ar maxdata
.Op Fl t Op cnisuwy
.Op Fl p Ar pid
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays the kernel trace files produced with
.Xr ktrace 1
in human readable format.
By default, the file
.Pa ktrace.out
in the current directory is displayed, which may be overridden by the
.Fl f
option.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a
Display full human readable output.
This option turns on
.Fl c
and
.Fl R .
.It Fl c
Display the cpu the thread is executing on.
.It Fl d
Display all numbers in decimal.
.It Fl j
Use a fixed format output, otherwise a more human readable output is used.
.It Fl f Ar file
Display the specified file instead of
.Pa ktrace.out .
.It Fl l
Loop reading the trace file, once the end-of-file is reached, waiting for
more data.
.It Fl m Ar maxdata
Display at most
.Ar maxdata
bytes when decoding I/O; set to
.Cm 0
to disable the size limit.
.It Fl p Ar pid
Display only records for process
.Ar pid .
.It Fl n
Suppress ad hoc translations.
Normally
.Nm
tries to decode many system calls into a more human readable format.
For example,
.Xr ioctl 2
values are replaced with the macro name and
.Va errno
values are replaced with the
.Xr strerror 3
string.
Suppressing this feature yields a more consistent output format and is
easily amenable to further processing.
.It Fl R
Display relative timestamps (time since previous entry).
.It Fl T
Display absolute timestamps for each entry (seconds since epoch).
.It Fl t Ar cnisuwy
See the
.Fl t
option of
.Xr ktrace 1 .
