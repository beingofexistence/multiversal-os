#
# The include file <bsd.own.mk> set common variables for owner,
# group, mode, and directories. Defaults are in brackets.
#
#
# +++ variables +++
#
# DESTDIR	Change the tree where the file gets installed. [not set].
#		Typical usage is ${DESTDIR}/usr/bin/...  Note that this
#		variable is not used to determine where programs access
#		auxillary data, only where everything is installed.
#
# DISTDIR	Change the tree where the file for a distribution
# 		gets installed (see /usr/src/release/Makefile). [not set]
#
# TOOLS_PREFIX	Change the tree where the program will search for auxillary
#		program binaries.  Defaults to <empty>.  e.g. usage is in
#		the typical form ${TOOLS_PREFIX}/usr/libexec/...
#
#		This is primarily used when generating cross-building tools
#		where the cross-building tools must exec auxillary binaries
#		which are themselves cross-built tools.
#
#		This variable specifies how a program looks for data, it does
#		NOT specify where a program installs data.
#
# USRDATA_PREFIX
#		Change the tree where the program will search for auxillary
#		data files.  Defaults to ${TOOLS_PREFIX}
#
#		Note that while auxillary program binaries and auxillary
#		data files are usually installed in the same tree, there
#		are cases where they might not be.  For example, when
#		buildworld generates the cross compile tools it must install
#		auxillary binaries in the ctools obj hiearchy but those
#		binaries must access data from the world obj hierarchy.
#
#		This variable specifies how a program looks for data, it does
#		NOT specify where a program installs data.
#
# INCLUDEDIR
#		Change the tree where header files are to be installed.
#		Defaults to /usr/include.  Note that use of INCLUDEDIR
#		is typically prefixed by ${DESTDIR}.
#
# COMPRESS_CMD	Program to compress documents. 
#		Output is to stdout. [gzip -cn]
#
# COMPRESS_EXT	File name extension of ${COMPRESS_CMD} command. [.gz]
#
# STRIP		The flag passed to the install program to cause the binary
#		to be stripped.  This is to be used when building your
#		own install script so that the entire system can be made
#		stripped/not-stripped using a single knob. [-s]
#
# BINOWN	Binary owner. [root]
#
# BINGRP	Binary group. [wheel]
#
# BINMODE	Binary mode. [555]
#
# CCVER		Default compiler version
# GCCLIBDIR	Default gcc subdirectory [${LIBDIR}/${CCVER}]
# GCCSHLIBDIR	Default gcc subdirectory [${SHLIBDIR}/${CCVER}]
#
# NOBINMODE	Mode for non-executable files. [444]
#
# LIBDIR	Base path for libraries. [/usr/lib]
#
# LIBDATADIR	Base path for misc. utility data files. [/usr/libdata]
#
# LINTLIBDIR	Base path for lint libraries. [/usr/libdata/lint]
#
# SHLIBDIR	Base path for shared libraries. [${LIBDIR}]
#
# LIBOWN	Library mode. [${BINOWN}]
#
# LIBGRP	Library group. [${BINGRP}]
#
# LIBMODE	Library mode. [${NOBINMODE}]
#
#
# SHAREDIR	Base path for architecture-independent ascii
#		text files. [/usr/share]
#
# SHAREOWN	ASCII text file owner. [root]
#
# SHAREGRP	ASCII text file group. [wheel]
#
# SHAREMODE	ASCII text file mode. [${NOBINMODE}]
#
#
# MANDIR	Base path for manual installation. [${SHAREDIR}/man/man]
#
# MANOWN	Manual owner. [${SHAREOWN}]
#
# MANGRP	Manual group. [${SHAREGRP}]
#
# MANMODE	Manual mode. [${NOBINMODE}]
#
#
# NLSDIR	Base path for National Language Support files
#		installation (see localedef(1)). [${SHAREDIR}/nls]
#
# NLSGRP	National Language Support files group. [${SHAREOWN}]
#
# NLSOWN	National Language Support files owner. [${SHAREGRP}]
