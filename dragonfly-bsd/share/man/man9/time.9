.Sh NAME
.Nm boottime ,
.Nm time_second
.Nd system time variables
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/time.h
.Pp
.Vt extern struct timeval boottime ;
.Vt extern time_t time_second ;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Va boottime
variable holds the system boot time.
The
.Va time_second
variable is the system's
.Dq wall time
clock to the second.
.Pp
The
.Xr microtime 9 ,
.Xr getmicrotime 9 ,
.Xr nanotime 9 ,
and
.Xr getnanotime 9
functions can be used to get the current time in an atomic manner.
Similarly, the
.Xr microuptime 9 ,
.Xr getmicrouptime 9 ,
.Xr nanouptime 9 ,
and
.Xr getnanouptime 9
functions can be used to get the time elapsed since boot in an atomic manner.
The
.Va boottime
variable may be read and written without special precautions.
