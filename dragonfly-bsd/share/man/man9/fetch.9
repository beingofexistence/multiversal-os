.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions are designed to copy small amounts of data from user-space.
.Pp
The
.Nm
routines provide the following functionality:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fn fuwordadd32"
.It Fn fubyte
Fetches a byte of data from the user-space address
.Fa base .
.It Fn fuword32
Fetches 32 bits of data from the user-space address
.Fa base .
.It Fn fuwordadd32
Fetches 32 bits of data from the user-space address
.Fa p ,
adds
.Fa val ,
and stores the result back to the user-space address
.Fa p .
.It Fn fuword64
Fetches 64 bits of data from the user-space address
.Fa base .
.It Fn fuwordadd64
Fetches 64 bits of data from the user-space address
.Fa p ,
adds
.Fa val ,
and stores the result back to the user-space address
.Fa p .

.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
functions return the data fetched or -1 on failure.
