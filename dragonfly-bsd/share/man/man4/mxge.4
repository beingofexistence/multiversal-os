.Sh NAME
.Nm mxge
.Nd "Myricom Myri10GE 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device mxge"
.Cd "device mxgefw"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_mxge_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Express 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on
the Myricom LANai Z8E chip.
The driver supports Transmit/Receive checksum offload,
TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO),
multiple reception queues,
multiple tranmission queues and
multiple vector MSI-X.
.\"Support for Jumbo frames is not yet implemented, while support for
.\"as well as Large Receive Offload (LRO) is not
.\"implemented in
Using multiple vector MSI-X requires that Myri10GE NIC be capable of MSI-X.
Older Myri10GE NICs can be field upgraded to add MSI-X using the
"Myri-10G Network Adapter Toolkit" for FreeBSD or Linux
which is available from
.Pa https://www.myricom.com/support/downloads/tools/myri-10g-toolkit.html .
.Pp
For questions related to hardware requirements,
refer to the documentation supplied with your Myri10GE adapter.
All hardware requirements listed apply to use with
.Dx .
For further hardware information, see
.Pa http://www.myricom.com .
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm forcepause"
.It Cm rxpause
Enable flow control PAUSE reception.
Due to hardware limitation,
this will also enable PAUSE transmission.
.It Cm txpause
Enable flow control PAUSE transmission.
Due to hardware limitation,
this will also enable PAUSE reception.
.It Cm forcepause
Force flow control PAUSE operation as configured by
.Cm rxpause
and
.Cm txpause
media options.
This media option can't be turned off.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
The
.Nm
driver supports
.Xr polling 4 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on the
Myricom LANai Z8E chips:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Myricom 10GBase-CX4 (10G-PCIE-8A-C, 10G-PCIE-8AL-C)
.It
Myricom 10GBase-R (10G-PCIE-8A-R, 10G-PCIE-8AL-R)

.El
.Sh TUNABLES
.Em X
is the device unit number.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va hw.mxge.msix.enable Va hw.mxgeX.msix.enable
By default,
the driver will use MSI-X
if it is supported.
This behaviour can be turned off by setting this tunable to 0.
.It Va hw.mxge.msi.enable Va hw.mxgeX.msi.enable
If MSI-X is disabled and MSI is supported,
the driver will use MSI.
This behavior can be turned off by setting this tunable to 0.
.It Va hw.mxgeX.msi.cpu
If MSI is used, it specifies the MSI's target CPU.
.It Va hw.mxge.num_slices Va hw.mxgeX.num_slices
If MSI-X is used,
this value determines the maximum number of slices the driver
will attempt to use.
Setting this value to 0 allows driver to enable as many slices
as allowed by the number of CPUs.
Each slice is comprised of one reception queue and one transmission
queue.
The transmission queue of each slice,
except the first slice,
could be disabled.
The default value is 0.
.It Va hw.mxge.multi_tx Va hw.mxgeX.multi_tx
If more than 1 slice is enabled,
this tunable controls whether the tranmission queue of each
slice should be enabled.
Setting this tunable to 0 will only enable the transmission queue
on the first slice.
The default value is 1.
.It Va hw.mxge.use_rss
This tunable controls whether standard RSS input hash function or
chip private input hash function should be used.
Using standard RSS input hash function degenerates reception
performance significantly.
The default value is 0.
.It Va hw.mxge.intr_coal_delay
This value delays the generation of all interrupts in units of
1 microsecond.
The default value is 150.
.It Va hw.mxge.flow_ctrl
The default flow control settings.
Supported values are:
force-full (forcefully enable PAUSE reception and transmission).
force-none (forcefully disable flow control PAUSE operation).
Default is force-none.
.El
.Sh MIB Variables
A number of per-interface variables are implemented in the
.Va dev.mxge. Ns Em X
branch of the
.Xr sysctl 3
MIB.
.Bl -tag -width "firmware_version"
.It Va firmware_version
The version string of firmware that is currently loaded by the driver.
It is read-only.
.It Va use_rss
See tunable
.Va hw.mxge.use_rss .
Flipping its value will cause chip reinitialization.
.It Va intr_coal_delay
See tunable
.Va hw.mxge.intr_coal_delay .
