.Sh NAME
.Nm km
.Nd AMD K10 temperature sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device km"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
km_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the temperature sensors available in the
AMD Family 10h, 11h, 12h, 14h, 15h and 16h processors.
.Pp
Each chip reports one temperature sensor.
Multiprocessor systems have one instance of
.Nm
per chip.
The highest resolution supported by the driver is 0.125 degC.
.Pp
Sensor values are made available through the
.Dv HW_SENSORS
.Xr sysctl 3
interface,
and can be monitored with the
.Xr systat 1
.Ar sensors
display,
.Xr sensorsd 8
and
.Xr sysctl 8
.Ar hw.sensors .
For example, with an
.Tn AMD
.Tn Phenom X4
9850 Black Edition 2.5GHz
.Tn Socket AM2+
125W quad-core processor:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
%sysctl hw.sensors.km0
hw.sensors.km0.temp0: 60.50 degC
.Ed
