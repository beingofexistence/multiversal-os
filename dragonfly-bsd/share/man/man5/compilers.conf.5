.Dt COMPILERS.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm compilers.conf
.Nd configuration file for external compilers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /etc/compilers.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file allows to configure
.Dq external
compilers for usage with the
.Dx
.Xr build 7
system.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/defaults/compilers.conf
file specifies the default settings for all variables, the
.Pa /etc/compilers.conf
file specifies override settings.
.Pp
The following variable definitions are mandatory:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va <version>_INCOPTCXX"
.It Va <version>_CC
The pathname of the
.Nm cc
compiler.
.It Va <version>_CXX
The pathname of the
.Nm c++
and
.Nm CC
compilers.
.It Va <version>_CPP
The pathname of the
.Nm cpp
pre-processor.
.It Va <version>_INCOPT
The include flags passed to the invocation of every version of c compiler,
c++ compiler, and pre-processor program.
This is normally set to the
predefined STD_INCOPT variable.
.It Va <version>_INCOPTCXX
The include flags passed to the invocation of every version of c++
compiler.
This is normally set to either the DPORT_GCC_STD_INCOPTXX or
DPORT_CLANG_STD_INCOPTXX predefined variables.
.El
.Pp
These variables are optionally available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va <version>_INCOPTCXX"
.It Va <version>_GCC
The pathname of the
.Nm gcc
compiler.
.It Va <version>_GXX
The pathname of the
.Nm g++
compiler.
.It Va <version>_GCOV
The pathname of the
.Nm gcov
coverage testing tool.
.\"
.\" Uncomment the following after clang is brought into base
.\".It Va <version>_CLANG
.\"The pathname of the
.\".Nm clang
.\"compiler.
.\".It Va <version>_CLANGCXX
.\"The pathname of the
.\".Nm clang++
.\"compiler.
.\".It Va <version>_CLANGCPP
.\"The pathname of the
.\".Nm clang-cpp
.\"pre-processor.
.\"
.It Va <version>_CFLAGS
Additional flags to pass to the c compilers.
.It Va <version>_CXXFLAGS
Additional flags to pass to the c++ compilers.
.It Va <version>_CPPFLAGS
Additional flags to pass to the pre-processors.
.El
.Pp
Currently, defaults are provided for the
.Xr dports 7
compilers of
.Nm clang10
.Pa ( devel/clang10 ) .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
In
.Dx ,
compilers are selected by setting the
.Ev CCVER
variable.
The
.Pa cpp ,
.Pa cc ,
etc\&. programs in
.Pa /usr/bin
are actually links to the
.Xr objformat 1
deflector program which is responsible for executing the
correct programs (located in
.Pa /usr/libexec/$CCVER ) .
.Pp
Traditionally,
.Dx
has 2 compilers in base, one of which is the default compiler and the other
is either a newer or older version.
In order to allow additional non-base compilers into
.Dx Ap s
build process,
.Xr objformat 1
deflects to
.Pa /usr/libexec/custom
when
.Ev CCVER Ap s
setting is not one of the compilers in base.
This directory contains a
.Pa cc
wrapper script (and some links to it).
The wrapper script then takes care of making the compiler look and behave
like a compiler in base.
.Pp
The settings in
.Nm
specify paths and flags for the
.Pa /usr/libexec/custom/cc
script.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /etc/compilers.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/compilers.conf
external compiler configuration file
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Once configured the compiler can be used like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
env CCVER=<version> make
.Ed
.Pp
To try building world and kernel, use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/src
env WORLD_CCVER=<version> make buildworld
env WORLD_CCVER=<version> make buildkernel KERNCONF=MYCONF
.Ed

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
file first appeared in
.Dx 2.3 .
