 * The following paths are searched in order to find calendar files for
 * inclusion:
 *     ~/.calendar
 *     /etc/calendar
 *     /usr/share/calendar
 *
 * If you want to modify the calendar files installed at
 * '/usr/share/calendar', copy them to '/etc/calendar'
 * or '~/.calendar' and edit there, so that the changes will be kept
 * after system upgrade.
