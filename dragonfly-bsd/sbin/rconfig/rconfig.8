.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides simple remote configurator functionality.  In client mode
.Nm
will broadcast a request for the specified configuration tag over available
interfaces (or you can specify an IP), locate a server capable of supplying
the tag, then connect to, download, and run the script associate with the
tag.  In server mode
.Nm
will listen on port 257 for broadcast requests (UDP) and connections (TCP).
Note that UDP based requests are only responded to if the requested tag
is available.  You can run the server on multiple machines on the LAN
serving different tags or, if you wish to provide a backup, serving the
same tags, or a mix.  The client will use the first matching tag it encounters.
.Pp
The following command line options are available when operating in client mode:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a
.Nm
will broadcast a request for the 'auto' tag on all available interfaces.
No additional arguments are necessary.
.It Fl W Ar workdir
Specify the working directory for script downloads.  The default is
.Pa /tmp .
.It Fl v
Verbose mode prints additional information during program execution.
.It host[:tag]
Specify any number of remote IP addresses or broadcast addresses.  If no
tag is specified
.Nm
defaults to 'auto'.  If you specify just a tag using :tag the broadcast
address for all available interfaces will be used.  The
.Fl a
option should not be used in that case.
.El
.Pp
The following command line options are available when operating in server mode:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl s
This option is required to operate
.Nm
as a server.
.It Fl a
.Nm
will bind to and listen on all available interfaces.  If this option is not
used you must specify a particular IP address or addresses to bind to.  The
server listens on port 257 for both UDP and TCP.
.It Fl T Ar tagdir
Specify the directory containing the tag scripts.  The default is
.Pa /usr/local/etc/rconfig .
Tag scripts are in the form:
.Pa tagname.sh .
The tag name can only consist of alphabets (lower and upper letters),
digits (zero to nine), underscore (_), dot (.),
minus (-) and plus (+) symbols.
.It Fl C Ar configfiles
Specify server configuration files (currently unused).
.It Fl v
Verbose mode prints additional information during program execution.
.It bind_address
Specify any number of IP addresses or hostnames corresponding to machine
local addresses that the server will bind to and listen on.
