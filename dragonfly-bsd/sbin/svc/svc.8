.Sh NAME
.Nm svc
.Nd build an environment and monitor/maintain a service or command
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl options
.Ar directive
.Ar label
.Op arguments-to-directive
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program which can build, monitor, and manage a simple environment
and execute a command within that environment.
It uses the
.Xr procctl 2
system call to round-up all processes and sub-processes created under the
environment.
It can detect when the specific command or the command and all processes
exit and perform some action, and it can do a few relatively simple support
functions to terminate, restart, or terminate/re-initiate.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Debug mode.  Additional debug output is printed.
This will also force
.Fl f .
.It Fl f
Foreground mode.  Instead of fork/detaching the service, the service itself
runs in the foreground when the
.Ar init
directive is specified.  The pid will not be printed in this case.
.It Fl h
Display quick help for directives and exit.
.It Fl p Ar directory
Specify the directory to store pidfiles and sockets in, and to search
for active labels.
If not specified, the default is
.Pa /var/run .
If specified as
.Ar none ,
no pidfile will be created or maintained.  The
.Ar none
specification is not recommended except in combination with
.Fl f
.Fl x .
.It Fl r Ar timo
Specify the restart delay and enable automatic restarts if the original
command under management exits, even if other processes are still present.
This option also modifies the behavior of the
.Ar stop
service command, causing it to kill only the main process under management.
Any forked children will be left intact.
This option is exclusive with
.Fl R .
.It Fl R Ar timo
Specify the restart delay and enable automatic restarts if all processes
under management exit.
This option also modifies the behavior of the
.Ar stop
service command, causing it to kill all processes under management.
This option is exclusive with
.Fl r .
.It Fl x
Causes the service demon itself to exit if the service being monitored
exits or is stopped.
Specify as an option to the left of the
.Ar init
directive.
.Nm
will still use
.Fl r
or
.Fl R
to indicate what is considered a dead service (some or all of the processes).
If neither is specified,
.Fl r
is assumed.  If specified, the timeout is irrelevant as there will be no
restart.
.Pp
This option also issues a
.Ar stopall
directive before exiting.  That is, it will still ensure that all processes
running under the service, either direct or indirect, are dead before the
service itself exits.
.It Fl s
Causes the service demon to issue a
.Xr sync 2
command after stopping or killing a service.
.It Fl t Ar timo
When stopping processes under management, specify the amount of time
allowed to elapse after sending a SIGTERM before sending a SIGKILL.
If 0 is specified, only SIGKILL will be sent.
The default is 10 seconds.
.It Fl u Ar user
Set the uid and gid of the command to execute based on the user.
The uid or username must exist in the password file.
The gid may be overridden by the
.Fl g
or
.Fl G
options.
The service demon itself is not affected.
.Pp
Specified when initializing a new service, has no effect for other directives.
Cannot be overridden in
.Ar start
or
.Ar restart .
.It Fl g Ar group
Set the gid of the command to execute.
This will override the user's gid set via the
.Fl u
option.
The service demon itself is not affected.
.Pp
Specified when initializing a new service, has no effect for other directives.
Cannot be overridden in
.Ar start
or
.Ar restart .
.It Fl G Ar group-list
Set the group-list of the command to execute.  The service demon itself is not
affected.
This will completely override all other assumed or specified GIDs.
.Pp
Specified when initializing a new service, has no effect for other directives.
Cannot be overridden in
.Ar start
or
.Ar restart .
.It Fl l Ar path
Set the logfile path for the command.
If not specified, no logfile will be created.
However, the service monitor will still keep track of the last ~8KB or
so of stdout/stderr output.
.Pp
Specified when initializing a new service, has no effect for other directives.
.It Fl m
May be used in combination with
.Fl c
or
.Fl j
to automatically mount /dev in a chroot or jail.
It will be left mounted through stops and starts and will be unmounted
when
.Nm
is told to exit.
.Pp
Specified when initializing a new service, has no effect for other directives.
.It Fl c Ar directory
Chroot into the specified directory when executing or re-executing the
command.  The service itself stays outside the chroot.
If
.Fl m
is also specified, the service will automatically mount /dev in the chroot
if it does not already exist and unmount it when the service exits.  The
mount remains in place when the service is stopped.
.Pp
Specified when initializing a new service, has no effect for other directives.
Cannot be overridden in
.Ar start
or
.Ar restart .
.It Fl j Ar directory
Create a jail and operate in a manner similar to a chroot.
.It Fl k Ar jail-spec
Additional specification for the jail.  See below.
.It Fl T Ar title
Tell
.Nm
to use
.Xr setproctitle 3
to adjust what shows up in a ps command, to make process lists easier to
diagnose.
.It Fl F Ar restarts:pertimo
Specify failure timing.
If a service is automatically restarted more than the specified number
within the specified period, the service is considered to be in a failed
state when it next dies and will no longer be restarted.
.Pp
The situation will be syslogged and an email will be sent to
.Ar service-errors
with a description of the problem if the service is running as root.
If the service is running as a user, the email is sent to the user.
The system operator should generally setup a mail alias to point
.Ar service-errors
to the desired destination.
.Pp
This feature is disabled by default.
If you only specify the restart count the rate will default to
per 60 seconds.
Specify as an option to the left of the
.Ar init
directive.
.It Ar directive Op arguments-to-directive
Specify a directive (see below).
.It Ar label
Specify a label to name or locate the service.
Note that most directives allow a label prefix to be specified, affecting
multiple services.
If your label is postfixed by a number, you should use a fixed-width
0-fill field for the number or risk some confusion.
.El
.Pp
All timeouts and delays are specified in seconds.
.Pp
If neither
.Fl r
or
.Fl R
is specified in the
.Ar init
directive, the service will not automatically restart if the underlying
processes exit.  The service demon will remain intact unless
.Fl x
has been specified.
.Pp
.Nm
always creates a pid file in the pid directory named
.Pa service.<label>.pid
and maintains an open descriptor with an active exclusive
.Xr flock 2
on the file.
Scripts can determine whether the service demon itself is running or not
via the
.Xr lockf 1
utility, or may use the convenient
.Ar status
directive and check the exit code to get more detailed status.
In addition, a service socket is created in the pid directory named
.Pa service.<label>.sk
which
.Nm
uses to communicate with a running service demon.
.Pp
Note that the service demon itself will not exit when the executed command
exits unless you have used the
.Fl x
option, or the
.Ar exit
or
.Ar kill
directives.
.Pp
Some RC services, such as sendmail, may maintain multiple service processes
and name each one with a postfix to the label.
By specifying just the prefix, your directives will affect all matching
labels.
.Pp
For build systems the
.Fl x
option is typically used, sometimes with the
.Fl f
option, and allowed to default to just waiting for the original command
exec to exit.
This will cause the service demon to then kill any remaining hanger-ons
before exiting.
.Sh DIRECTIVES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar init Ar label Ar exec-command Op arguments
Start a new service with the specified label.
This command will fail if the label is already in-use.
This command will detach a new service demon, create a pidfile, and
output the pid of the new service demon to stdout before returning.
.Pp
If the
.Ar exec-command
is a single word and not an absolute or relative path, the system
command path will be searched for the command.
.It Ar start
Start a service that has been stopped.
The label can be a wildcard prefix so, for example, if there are
three sendmail services (sendmail01, sendmail02, sendmail03), then
the label 'sendmail' will operate on all three.
.Pp
If the service is already running, this directive will be a NOP.
.It Ar stop
Stop a running service by sending a TERM signal and later a KILL signal
if necessry, to some or all processes
running under the service.  The processes signaled depend on the original
.Fl r
or
.Fl R
options specified when the service was initiated.
These options, along with
.Fl t
may also be specified in this directive to override
(but not permanently change) the original options.
.Pp
The service demon itself remains intact.
.It Ar stopall
This is a short-hand for
.Fl R Ar 0
.Ar stop .
It will kill all sub-processes of the service regardless of whether
.Fl r
or
.Fl R
was used in the original
.Ar init
directive.
.It Ar restart
Execute the
.Ar stop
operation, sleep for a few seconds based on the original
.Fl r
or
.Fl R
options, and then execute the
.Ar start
operation.
These options, along with
.Fl t
may also be specified in this directive to override
(but not permanently change) the original options.
.It Ar exit
Execute the
.Ar stop
operation but override prior options and terminate ALL processes
running under the service.
The service demon itself then terminates and must be init'd again
to restart.
.Pp
This function will also remove any stale pid and socket files.
.It Ar kill
Execute the
.Ar stop
operation but override prior options and terminate ALL processes
running under the service.
Also force the delay to 0, bypassing SIGTERM and causing SIGKILL to be
sent.
The service demon itself then terminates and must be init'd again
to restart.
.Pp
This function will also remove any stale pid and socket files.
.It Ar list
List a subset of labels and their status.
If no label is specified, all active labels are listed.
.It Ar status
Print the status of a particular label, exit with a 0 status if
the service exists and is still considered to be running.
Exit with 1 if the service exists but is considered to be stopped.
Exit with 2 if the service does not exist.
If multiple labels match, the worst condition found becomes the exit code.
.Pp
Scripts that use this feature can conveniently use the
.Ar start
directive to start any matching service that is considered stopped.
The directive is a NOP for services that are considered to be running.
.It Ar log
The service demon monitors stdout/stderr output from programs it runs
continuously and will remember the last ~8KB or so, which can be
dumped via this directive.
.It Ar logf
This works the same as
.Ar log
but continues to monitor and dump the output until you ^C.
In order to avoid potentially stalling the service under management,
gaps may occur if the monitor is unable to keep up with the log
output.
.It Ar tailf
This works similarly to
.Ar logf
but dumps fewer lines of log history before dovetailing into
continuous monitoring.
.It Ar logfile Ar label Op path
Re-open, set, or change the logfile path for the monitor,
creating a new logfile if necessary.
The logfile is created by the parent monitor (the one not running in
a chroot or jail or as a particular user or group).
This way the service under management cannot modify or destroy it.
.Pp
It is highly recommended that you specify an absolute path when
changing the logfile.
If you wish to disable the logfile, set it to /dev/null.
Disabling the logfile does not prevent you from viewing the
last ~8KB and/or monitoring any logged data.
.It Ar help
Display quick help for directives.
.El
.Pp
Description of nominal operation
.Xr procctl 2
system call.
.Sh JAIL-SPECIFICATIONS
A simple jail just chroots into a directory, possibly mounts /dev, and
allows all current IP bindings to be used.
The service demon itself does not run in the jail, but will keep the
jail intact across
.Ar stop
and
.Ar start/restart
operations by leaving a forked process intact inside.
If the jail is destroyed, the service demon will re-create it if necessary
on a
.Ar start/restart .
.Fl k
option may be used to specify additional parameters.
Parameters are comma-delimited with no spaces.
Values may be specified in the name=value format.
For example:
.Fl k Ar clean,ip=1.2.3.4,ip=5.6.7.8
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar clean
The jail is handed a clean environment, similar to what
.Xr jail 8
does.
.It Ar ip=addr
The jail is allowed to bind to the specified IP address.  This option may
be specified multiple times.
.El
.Sh SIGNALS
Generally speaking signals should not be sent to a service demon.
Instead, the command should be run with an appropriate directive to
adjust running behavior.
However, the service demon will act on signals as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv SIGTERM
The service demon will execute the
.Ar exit
directive.
.It Dv SIGHUP
The service demon will execute the
.Ar restart
directive.
.El
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Dx 4.0 .
