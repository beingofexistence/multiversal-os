 * Note that the spinlock structure is retained whether we are SMP or not,
 * so structures using embedded spinlocks do not change size for SMP vs UP
 * builds.
 *
 * DragonFly spinlocks use a basic count/flag system.  It has been shown to
 * be the quickest way of doing things over time.  Shared spinlocks are
 * supported (and even relatively optimal).
 *
 * There is no description field.  The wait description is pulled from
 * __func__ if the lock cannot be instantly obtained.
