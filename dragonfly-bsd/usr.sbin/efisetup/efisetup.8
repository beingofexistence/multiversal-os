.Sh NAME
.Nm efisetup
.Nd Create a complete UEFI install on a fresh drive
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s Ar swapsize{m,g}
.Op Fl S Ar serialno
.Ar drive
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program will create a fresh UEFI install of
.Dx
on a drive.
The drive will be completely reformatted and any prior contents will be
lost!
.Bl -tag -width 20m
.It Fl s Ar swapsize{m,g}
Specify the size of the swap partition, default is "8g".
.It Fl S Ar serialno
Specify the serial number of the device as it would appear
under
.Pa /dev/serno/* .
In most cases this is simply the reported serial number, however note that the
.Xr nvme 4
driver will tack on a namespace id to the reported serial number,
typically "-1".
Only specify the serial number, do not specify a path prefix.
If you use this option the script will install path references in fstab
and so forth using the
.Pa serno/
path.
If you do not use this option, the drive name will be used instead.
We recommend using this option.
.It Ar drive
Specify the drive, for example "nvme0".
You may omit the
.Pa /dev/
prefix if you wish.
The raw drive should be specified, do not specify a
.Pa serno/
path here.
.El
.Sh USAGE
.Nm
expects you to have completed a buildworld and buildkernel
sequence before running the program, see
.Xr build 7
for more information on how to build a fresh system.
.Pp
.Nm
will create a fresh GPT slice table with two slices,
install the required EFI boot files on slice 0, and
install a
.Dx
64-bit disklabel on slice 1.
The program will then proceed to create partitions 'a', 'b', and 'c'
in the disklabel, mount them, and install the world and kernel.
.Pp
After the world and kernel are installed,
.Nm
will make adjustments to the target
.Pa /boot/loader.conf ,
.Pa /etc/fstab ,
and
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
with the appropriate disk paths, then unmount.
.Pp
After completion of the operation you should be able to boot from the
drive and then finish up your adjustments to
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
to get the network up and so forth.
This script does only a very basic installation.
For a more substantial initial installation you should boot from a
.Dx
install image and select an EFI installation.

.Xr uefi 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Dx 4.8 .
