.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl df
.Op Fl p Ar pidfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon handles the resource management for the userspace implementation of
the XSI Interprocess Communication functions.
It is responsible for mapping shared memory, semaphores and message queues
into the clients' address spaces and it has to be running for the
userspace implementation to work.
.Pp
Clients connect to it through a
.Ux socket .
The daemon also monitors the
.Xr fork 2
system call and any children of a process using the userspace
implementation automatically connect to the daemon too.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
run in debugging mode (prints debug messages and implies
.Fl f )
.It Fl f

.Ar pidfile
instead of the default
.Pa /var/run/sysvipcd.pid .

.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the
.Ev USR_SYSVIPC
variable is set in a process' environment, the process and its children
will use the userspace implementation of the XSI Interprocess Communication
functions.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /var/run/sysvipc/sysvipc_socket" -compact
.It Pa /var/run/sysvipc/sysvipc_socket
