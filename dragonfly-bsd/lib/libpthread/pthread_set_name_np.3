.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread.h
.In pthread_np.h
.Ft void
.Fn pthread_set_name_np "pthread_t tid" "const char *name"
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_setname_np "pthread_t tid" "const char *name"

.Fn pthread_getname_np "pthread_t tid" "char *name" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_set_name_np
and
.Fn pthread_setname_np
functions set the internal name of the thread specified by the
.Fa tid
argument to the string value specified by the
.Fa name
argument.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_get_name_np
and
.Fn pthread_getname_np
functions get the internal name of the thread specified by the
.Fa tid
argument and store it in the buffer.
If the thread does not exist, the buffer is written as an empty line.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn pthread_getname_np
and
.Fn pthread_setname_np
will return 0.
Otherwise, an error is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn pthread_getname_np
and
.Fn pthread_setname_np
functions will fail if
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa name
parameter is outside the process's allocated address space.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa tid
argument specifies an invalid thread.
.It Bq Er ESRCH
No thread could be found in the current process corresponding to that
specified by the given thread ID
.Fa tid .
.El
.Pp
Because of the debugging nature of the
.Nm pthread_get_name_np
and
.Nm pthread_set_name_np
functions, all errors that may appear inside are silently ignored.
However, errno may still be set.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lwp_setname 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn pthread_set_name_np
and
.Fn pthread_get_name_np
functions are non-standard extensions.
While also non-standard,
.Fn pthread_setname_np
and
.Fn pthread_getname_np
are implemented by a larger number of operating
systems so they are in fact more portable.
