.Sh NAME
.Nm nanosleep ,

.Nd high resolution sleep
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In time.h
.Ft int
.Fo nanosleep
.Fa "const struct timespec *rqtp"
.Fa "struct timespec *rmtp"
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fo clock_nanosleep
.Fa "clockid_t clock_id"
.Fa "int flags"
.Fa "const struct timespec *rqtp"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Both
.Fn nanosleep
and
.Fn clock_nanosleep
allow to suspend the calling thread for an interval
measured in nanoseconds.
Compared to
.Fn nanosleep ,
.Fn clock_nanosleep
further allows the caller to select the clock against which
the suspension interval is to be measured,
and allows the suspension interval to be specified as either a relative
or an absolute value.
.Pp
If the
.Fa flags
argument is 0 (i.e., the
.Dv TIMER_ABSTIME
flag is not set),
the value specified in the
.Fa rqtp
argument is interpreted as an interval relative to the current time
measured in the clock specified by the
.Fa clock_id
argument.
Then
.Fn clock_nanosleep
suspends execution of the calling thread until either the
time interval specified by the
.Fa rqtp
argument has elapsed,
or a signal is delivered to the calling process and its
action is to invoke a signal-catching function or to terminate the
process.
.Pp
If the
.Fa flags
argument is
.Dv TIMER_ABSTIME ,
the value specified in the
.Fa rqtp
argument is interpreted as an absolute time measured by the
.Fa clock_id
clock.
Then
.Fn clock_nanosleep
suspends execution of the calling thread until either the
value of the clock specified by the
.Fa clock_id
argument reaches the absolute time specified by the
.Fa rqtp
argument,
or a signal is delivered to the calling process and its
action is to invoke a signal-catching function or to terminate the
process.
If, at the time of the call, the time value specified by
.Fa rqtp
is less than or equal to the time value of the specified clock, then
.Fn clock_nanosleep
returns immediately and the calling thread is not suspended.
.Pp
The suspension time may be longer than requested due to the
scheduling of other activity by the system.
An unmasked signal will terminate the sleep early, regardless of the
.Dv SA_RESTART
value on the interrupting signal.
The
.Fa rqtp
and
.Fa rmtp
arguments can point to the same object.
.Pp
The following
.Fa clock_id
values (see
.Xr clock_gettime 2
for their meanings) are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact -offset indent
.It
.Dv CLOCK_MONOTONIC
.It
.Dv CLOCK_MONOTONIC_FAST
.It
.Dv CLOCK_MONOTONIC_PRECISE
.It
.Dv CLOCK_REALTIME
.It
.Dv CLOCK_REALTIME_FAST
.It
.Dv CLOCK_REALTIME_PRECISE
.It
.Dv CLOCK_SECOND
.It
.Dv CLOCK_UPTIME
.It
.Dv CLOCK_UPTIME_FAST
.It
.Dv CLOCK_UPTIME_PRECISE
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn nanosleep
function behaves like
.Fn clock_nanosleep
with a
.Fa clock_id
argument of
.Dv CLOCK_REALTIME
and without the
.Dv TIMER_ABSTIME
flag in the
.Fa flags
argument.
.Pp
The use of these functions has no effect on the action or blockage of any signal.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return zero when the requested time has elapsed.
.Pp
If these functions return for any other reason, then
.Fn clock_nanosleep
will directly return the error number, and
.Fn nanosleep
will return \-1 with the global variable
.Va errno
set to indicate the error.
If a relative sleep is interrupted by a signal and
.Fa rmtp
is
.Pf non- Dv NULL ,
the timespec structure it references is updated to contain the
unslept amount (the request time minus the time actually slept).
.Sh ERRORS
These functions can fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
Either
.Fa rqtp
or
.Fa rmtp
points to memory that is not a valid part of the process
address space.
.It Bq Er EINTR
The function was interrupted by the delivery of a signal.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa rqtp
argument specified a nanosecond value less than zero
or greater than or equal to 1000 million.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa flags
argument contained an invalid flag.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa clock_id
argument was
.Dv CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID
or an unrecognized value.
.It Bq Er ENOTSUP
The
.Fa clock_id
argument was valid but not supported by this implementation of
.Fn clock_nanosleep .
