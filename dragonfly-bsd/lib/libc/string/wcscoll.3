.Sh NAME
.Nm wcscoll ,
.Nm wcscoll_l
.Nd compare wide strings according to current collation
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft int
.Fn wcscoll "const wchar_t *s1" "const wchar_t *s2"
.Ft int
.Fn wcscoll_l "const wchar_t *s1" "const wchar_t *s2" "locale_t locale"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcscoll
function compares the null-terminated strings
.Fa s1
and
.Fa s2
according to the current locale collation order.
In the
.Dq Li C
locale,
.Fn wcscoll
is equivalent to
.Fn wcscmp .
.Pp
The
.Fn wcscoll_l
function is identical to
.Fn wcscoll
but takes an explicit
.Fa locale
argument, whereas
.Fn wcscoll
uses the current global or per-thread locale.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn wcscoll
and
.Fn wcscoll_l
functions return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
if
.Fa s1
is greater than, equal to, or less than
.Fa s2 .
.Pp
No return value is reserved to indicate errors;
callers should set
.Va errno
to 0 before calling
.Fn wcscoll .
If it is non-zero upon return from
.Fn wcscoll ,
an error has occurred.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn wcscoll
and
.Fn wcscoll_l
functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
An invalid wide character code was specified.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Cannot allocate enough memory for temporary buffers.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr strcoll 3 ,
.Xr wcscmp 3 ,
.Xr wcsxfrm 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcscoll
function
conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .
The
.Fn wcscoll_l
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh BUGS
The current implementation of
.Fn wcscoll
and
.Fn wcscoll_l
only works in single-byte
.Dv LC_CTYPE
locales, and falls back to using
.Fn wcscmp
in locales with extended character sets.
