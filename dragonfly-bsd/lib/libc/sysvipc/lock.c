		 * we keep a simple count of all the rdlocks held by
		 * a thread.  If a thread holds any rdlocks it is

		 * rdlock.  If there are blocked writers and precedence
		 * is given to them, then that would result in the thread
		 * deadlocking.  So allowing a thread to take the rdlock

		 * deadlock.  I hope the reader can follow that logic ;-)
