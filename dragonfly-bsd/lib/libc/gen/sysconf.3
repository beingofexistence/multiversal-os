.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call to
.Fn sysconf
is not successful, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
Otherwise, if the variable is associated with functionality that is not
supported, \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is not modified.
Otherwise, the current variable value is returned.
.Pp
Because \-1 is a valid return value upon success, applications wishing
to check for real error conditions should set
.Va errno
to 0, then call
.Fn sysconf ,
and check
.Va errno
if \-1 is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn sysconf
function may fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library function
.Xr sysctl 3 .
In addition, the following error may be reported:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of the
.Fa name
argument is invalid.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getconf 1 ,
.Xr pathconf 2 ,
.Xr confstr 3 ,

.Sh STANDARDS
Except for the fact that values returned by
.Fn sysconf
may change over the lifetime of the calling process,
this function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-88 .
.Pp
.Dv _SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF
and
.Dv _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN
are nonstandard, but implemented in many systems.
