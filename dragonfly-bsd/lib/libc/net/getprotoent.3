.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getprotoent ,
.Fn getprotobyname ,
and
.Fn getprotobynumber
functions
each return a pointer to an object with the
following structure
containing the broken-out
fields of a line in the network protocol data base,
.Pa /etc/protocols .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct	protoent {
	char	*p_name;	/* official name of protocol */
	char	**p_aliases;	/* alias list */
	int	p_proto;	/* protocol number */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The members of this structure are:
.Bl -tag -width p_aliases
.It Fa p_name
The official name of the protocol.
.It Fa p_aliases
A zero terminated list of alternate names for the protocol.
.It Fa p_proto
The protocol number.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn getprotoent
function
reads the next line of the file, opening the file if necessary.
.Pp
The
.Fn setprotoent
function
opens and rewinds the file.
If the
.Fa stayopen
flag is non-zero,
the net data base will not be closed after each call to
.Fn getprotobyname
or
.Fn getprotobynumber .
.Pp
The
.Fn endprotoent
function
closes the file.
.Pp
The
.Fn getprotobyname
function
and
.Fn getprotobynumber
sequentially search from the beginning
of the file until a matching
protocol name or
protocol number is found,
or until
.Dv EOF
is encountered.
.Pp
The
.Fn getprotoent_r ,
.Fn getprotobynumber_r ,
and
.Fn getprotobyname_r
functions are reentrant versions of the above functions that take a
pointer to a
.Vt protoent
structure which is used to store state information.
The structure must be zero-filled before it is used
and should be considered opaque for the sake of portability.
These functions also take a pointer to another
.Vt protoent
structure which is used to store the results of the database lookup.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn getprotoent ,
.Fn getprotobynumber ,
and
.Fn getprotobyname
functions return a pointer to a
.Vt protoent
structure on success or a null pointer if end-of-file
is reached or an error occurs.
.Pp
The
.Fn getprotoent_r ,
.Fn getprotobynumber_r ,
and
.Fn getprotobyname_r
functions return 0 on success or \-1 if end-of-file
is reached or an error occurs.
.Sh FILES

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn getprotoent ,
.Fn getprotobynumber ,
.Fn getprotobyname ,
.Fn setprotoent ,
and
.Fn endprotoent
functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2004 .
.Pp
The
.Fn getprotoent_r ,
.Fn getprotobynumber_r ,
and
.Fn getprotobyname_r
functions are not currently standardized.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getprotoent ,
.Fn getprotobynumber ,
.Fn getprotobyname ,
.Fn setprotoent ,
and
.Fn endprotoent
functions appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn getprotoent_r ,
.Fn getprotobynumber_r ,
and
.Fn getprotobyname_r
functions appeared in
.Dx 2.1 .
.Sh BUGS
These functions use a thread-specific data space;
if the data is needed for future use, it should be
copied before any subsequent calls overwrite it.
Only the Internet
protocols are currently understood.
