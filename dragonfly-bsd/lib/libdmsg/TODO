#1 The encryption is really just a place-holder.  link_verifier is meant
   to be a per-message link-level verifier, meaning that the physical
   link (a tcp connection in this case) can modify it and then use it as
   a verifier on the other end.  It should be set to 0 in the original
   message.

   This is not yet implemented.  At the moment we rely on the 32-bit CRC
   as our verifier, and it is not really good enough for the task.

   - link verifier not yet implemented
   - kill link on link verifier error
   - Differentiate between end-to-end crc and link verifier

#2 the circuit stuff is a bit of a mess.
