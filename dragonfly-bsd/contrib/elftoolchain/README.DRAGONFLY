ELF Tool Chain
==============

Original source can be checked out with subversion:
svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/elftoolchain/code/trunk elftoolchain

rev  = 3255
date = 28 Oct 2015

A list of files and directories removed is in README.DELETED

Currently only libelf is built and it is only used internally.
In the future, the entire toolchain could be added, perhaps to
replace one of the binutils sets.
