This directory is for regression test programs.

A regression test program is one that will exercise a particular bit of the
system to check that we have not reintroduced an old bug.

Please make a subdir per program, and add a brief description to this file.

nfsmmap		Some tests to exercise some tricky cases in NFS and mmap
p1003_1b	Exercise 1003.1B scheduler
sysvmsg 	SysV IPC Message Queue Regression Utility
sysvsem 	SysV IPC Semaphore Regression Utility
